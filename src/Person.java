public class Person {
	//Part 2:
		//4. Create a Person class, with 2 member variables - name and superpower.

		//5. Using the pattern in Part 1, add getter and setter methods for the member variables of the Person class.

		//6. Now, make a Runner class that creates 3 different people, sets their superpowers, and prints the value returned by the default toString() method.

		//7. Override the default toString() method by implementing a toString() method 
		//on the Person class that returns "<name> has mad <superpower> skills".
